##Description
Have you every said, or heard someone say, "I have a great idea for an app"?

As a developer myself, it's a phrase that I have become quite familiar with. I find myself discarding most app ideas I think of, or that get pitched to me because: I don't have the time, enough resources or initial interest to act on that idea. As time has gone on, and technology has matured I have found myself racking my brain to remember a particular app idea that all the sudden seems realistic or relevant.

Stash. was developed to be a dead simple way to get those app ideas saved and ready to revisit down the road. To Stash. an idea you need to do three things:

1. Pick an icon that represents the App Store category that best fits the idea.

2. Give the app a working title

3. Describe the app in enough detail that you will remember it later. 

4. Stash It!
